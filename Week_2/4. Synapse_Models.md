## Introduction

Last week we went through a lot of detailed biology, and now we're going to turn that into relatively simple equations.

## Level of Abstraction

Previously we explained how when a spike arrives at a transmitting synapse, a neurotransmitter is released. This neurotransmitter causes a change in the conductance of the receiving cell due to the opening of an associated ion channel. In turn, this leads to an input current following the same sort of equations we saw for the [Hodgkin-Huxley](Week1/Biophysical_Model.md) formalism last week.
